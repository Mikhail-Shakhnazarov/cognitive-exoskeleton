## What This Is

Large language models enable cheap transformation of symbolic content--rewriting, reorganizing, compressing, expanding text-like artifacts at scale. This creates a new problem: **semantic drift**. Under iteration, meanings slide, scope creeps, definitions change silently, and understanding becomes unstable across sessions and runtimes.

The cognitive exoskeleton framework provides coordination discipline that exploits transformation capability while preventing drift through:

- **Port separation**: Interpretation and execution as isolated roles with explicit contracts
- **Artifact contracts**: Specifications, not assumed context, govern work
- **Operator termination**: Human authority closes all decision loops
- **Verification surfaces**: Claims anchored to evidence, not plausibility
- **Learning capture**: Systematic capability development across projects

This repository contains the theoretical foundation, practical implementations, and working examples.

## Contents

### Theory
- **[Full Monograph](docs/MONOGRAPH.md)** - Complete theoretical treatment covering media theory, cybernetics, hermeneutics, dialectics, operator practice, and counterpositions (~15k words)
- **[Second-Order Writing](docs/SECOND_ORDER_WRITING.md)** - LLMs as transformation medium and the evolution of writing technologies (~4k words)
- **[Glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md)** - Key terms and concepts

### Practice
- **[devOS Implementation](implementations/devos/)** - Software development operator/operating system with working templates, protocols, and examples
- **[Examples](examples/)** - Sample artifacts demonstrating the system in use

### Reference
- **[Citation Guide](CITATION.md)** - How to cite this work

- **[Licenses](LICENSES.md)** - Dual licensing explanation

## Quick Start

**For practitioners wanting to use the system:**
1. Read [devOS README](implementations/devos/README.md) for practical introduction
2. Review [templates](implementations/devos/templates/) to understand artifact structure
3. Examine [examples](examples/) to see system in action
4. Start with one project using the discipline

**For researchers exploring the theory:**
1. Start with [Second-Order Writing](docs/SECOND_ORDER_WRITING.md) for accessible entry point
2. Read [Full Monograph](docs/MONOGRAPH.md) for comprehensive treatment
3. See [devOS](implementations/devos/) for how theory becomes operational

**For developers wanting to adapt this:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Examine [devOS implementation](implementations/devos/) as reference
4. Build your own specialized implementation (writeOS, researchOS, etc.)

## Why This Matters

Most approaches to "AI-assisted work" trend toward:
- Black-box automation (operator judgment atrophies)
- Conversational interfaces (false continuity, volatile memory)
- Vendor dependence (work coupled to specific tools)

Cognitive exoskeleton instead:
- Keeps operator judgment central (tool amplifies, doesn't replace)
- Externalizes understanding into artifacts (re-enterable, auditable)
- Remains tool-agnostic (coordination layer above specific LLMs)

The result: knowledge work where transformation is cheap but stability is maintained, where learning compounds systematically, and where human authority remains explicit.

## Status

This framework is operational and being refined through active use. The devOS implementation is being used for actual software development work. Additional implementations (writeOS, researchOS, etc.) are planned but not yet published.
