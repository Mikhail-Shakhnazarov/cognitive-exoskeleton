# packs/BOOT_PACK.md
BOOT_PACK v0.1. BOOT_PACK is the always-loaded hot set.

Contents:
- [KERNEL.md](KERNEL.md)
- [now.md](now.md)

Optional only if repeatedly needed for orientation:
- [REPO_MAP.md](REPO_MAP.md)

Boot procedure: load KERNEL.md, then now.md, then assemble a TASK_PACK for the next action. Missing decisions become friction; no guessing.
