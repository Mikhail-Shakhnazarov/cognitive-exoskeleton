# Documentation

Complete theoretical and conceptual documentation for the Cognitive Exoskeleton framework.

## Reading Paths

### For Quick Understanding

Start here if you want to grasp the core ideas quickly:

1. **[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)** - Key terms and concepts (15 minutes)
2. **[SECOND_ORDER_WRITING.md](SECOND_ORDER_WRITING.md)** - LLMs as transformation medium (40 minutes)
3. **[devOS README](../implementations/devos/README.md)** - Practical implementation (20 minutes)

### For Deep Engagement

For comprehensive theoretical treatment:

1. **[MONOGRAPH.md](MONOGRAPH.md)** - Complete 6-part treatment covering:
   - Part I: The engineered object (architecture and artifacts)
   - Part II: Media and cognition (McLuhan, Heidegger, Buber)
   - Part III: Cybernetics, governance, subsidiarity (Beer, Ashby)
   - Part IV: Hermeneutics and language (Wittgenstein, Barthes)
   - Part V: Argumentation and operator practice (Aquinas, Marcus Aurelius)
   - Part VI: Counterpositions, failure modes, limits

This is the complete theoretical foundation (~15k words, 2-3 hours).

### For Practitioners

If you want to build with this:

1. **[devOS README](../implementations/devos/README.md)** - Software implementation overview
2. **[KERNEL.md](../implementations/devos/KERNEL.md)** - Core invariants
3. **[Templates](../implementations/devos/templates/)** - Artifact formats
4. **[Examples](../examples/)** - Working samples

## Core Concepts

### What Problem Does This Solve

LLMs enable cheap transformation of text and symbolic content. This creates **semantic drift**: under iteration, meanings slide, scope creeps, definitions change silently, and understanding becomes unstable across sessions.

The cognitive exoskeleton provides coordination discipline that:
- Exploits transformation capability
- Prevents drift through governance
- Preserves operator agency
- Makes work auditable and re-enterable

### How Does It Work

**Port separation**: Interpretation (Port B) and execution (Port A) are isolated roles with explicit contracts.

**Artifact contracts**: Specifications, not assumed context, govern work.

**Operator termination**: Human authority closes all decision loops.

**Verification surfaces**: Claims anchored to evidence, not plausibility.

**Learning capture**: Systematic capability development across projects.

### Who Is This For

**Practitioners**: People doing complex knowledge work with LLMs who need:
- Work to survive context switches and time gaps
- Learning to compound across projects
- Quality to be verifiable, not just plausible
- Authority to remain human, not drift to models

**Researchers**: People interested in:
- Tools for thought and augmented cognition
- Media theory and LLMs as medium
- Knowledge management and external cognition
- Governance for AI systems

**Developers**: People building:
- Coordination tools for LLM work
- Specialized implementations (writeOS, researchOS, etc.)
- Better practices for AI-assisted development
